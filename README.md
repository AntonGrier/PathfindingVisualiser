# Pathfinding Visualiser
Presenting the Pathfinding Visualiser! I have always been interested in video-game design concepts, particularly the use of pathfinding by AIs in the games I play. 
With my understanding of algorithms and a desire to learn more about web-development, I decided to build a React app to showcase these concepts. 
Please play around with different maze patterns, and see how these pathfinding algorithms traverse them.
