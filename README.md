# Pathfinding Visualiser
Presenting the Pathfinding Visualiser! I have always been interested in video-game design concepts, particularly the use of pathfinding by AIs in the games I play. 
With my understanding of algorithms and a desire to learn more about web-development, I decided to learn about React and build an app to showcases these concepts. 
Please play around with different maze patterns, and see how these pathfinding algorithms traverse them. The path will recalibrate if you move either of the nodes. Right Click for a middle point!
